What happens if the `name` variable is not passed to the function?

if we will not pass `name` variable to function from exercise jsx-02

const sayHellowTo = (name) => {
  return <h1>hellow {name}!</h1>;
};

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <span>{sayHellowTo(* << here)}</span>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

we will recive an h1 tag with string 'hellow !' but we will not recive an err and still be able to
embedd function as it's an valid js expression.
